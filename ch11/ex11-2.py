# Population: Modify your function so it requires a third parameter,
# population. It should now return a signle string of the form City,
# Country - population xxx, such as Santiago, Chile - population 5000000.
# Run test_cities.py again. Make sure test_city_country() fails this time.
#
# Modify the function so the populatin parameter is optional. Run
# test_cities.py again, and make sure test_city_country() passes again.
#
# Write a second test called test_city_country_population() that verifies you
# can call your function with the values 'santiago', 'chillie', and
# 'population=50000000'. Run test_cities again, and make sure this new test
# passes.
