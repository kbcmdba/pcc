# Movie Tickets: A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on
# the person's age. If a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free; if
# they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10; and if they are over age 12,
# the ticket is $15. Write a loop in which you ask users their age, and then
# tell them the cost of their movie ticket.

    agestr = input("What is the age of the moviegoer? ")
    age = int(agestr)
    if age < 3:
        print("Your movie ticket is free.")

    else:
        print("Your movie ticket is $15.")
